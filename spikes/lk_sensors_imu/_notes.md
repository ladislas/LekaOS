#### IMU :
- apparently setting the INT1 pin as output to 0, then disabling I3C and then setting the INT1 pin back as input is not necessary anymore
    - probably was linked to the board being used in the IMU tests




#### Motors :
 - Setting the motors to 0.1 or lower does not provide enough torque to move the robot ( moving with the sphere or moving inside the sphere )
